4.  Make your changes and test them.

## Tests

README Wizard comes with a series of unit tests to ensure functionality remains consistent and reliable through updates. You can run these tests using the following command:

```
npm test
```

Here's an example of what the a test might look like: 

```
> static-site@1.0.0 test
> echo "Error: no test specified" && exit 1

"Error: no test specified"
```
- echo "Error: no test specified": This part echoes the message "Error: no test specified" to the console.
- &&: This operator is used to chain commands in a script. In this case, it means "if the previous command succeeds, then execute the next command."
- exit 1: This command exits the script with an exit code of 1. An exit code of 1 typically indicates an error or failure.

So, when you run npm test, it will simply print "Error: no test specified" to the console and exit with code 1, indicating that no tests have been defined.
